StackAndQueueExamples
This project demonstrates practical examples of fundamental data structures: Stack and Queue using C#.

Project Contents
Queue Example:
A sample that uses a queue to manage documents for printing. You can enqueue documents and then print them in the order they were added.

Stack Example:
A sample that uses a stack to implement text editing commands with Undo and Redo functionality.

Type text to append to the current text.

Use the command undo to revert the last change.

Use the command redo to reapply a previously undone change.

How to Use
Run the program.

Follow the console instructions to type text or commands (undo, redo, exit).

To try the queue example, uncomment the ExecuteQueueExample() call in the Main method.

Purpose
To learn the basics of Stack and Queue data structures and understand how to implement Undo/Redo functionality using a stack.
